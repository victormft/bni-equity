NOTES OF A FRUSTRATED TRANSLATOR
Zilog <dropmeaword@gmail.com>

It's wonderful that Goteo is multilingual from the get go. Most texts 
are saved in the database in several languages and Goteo features a 
text lookup library to fetch the correct text.

However for some reason this system is not used in the administration
pages. So no matter which language you set on the selector, the 
administration panel appears to be in Spanish only. 
(and the log message too)

For deployments in non-spanish speaking teams this is not so handy.

I have decided to implement translation of the admin panel using gettext
beccause it is a reasonably well understood approach and because it 
doesn't use the database. Also, having a standard way of tagging 
language dependant texts directly in the source code has the positive 
effect of being almost sellf documenting.

The index.php file is the global dispatcher and I have also made it
language aware so that the correct env variables are set for gettext to 
function correctly. This is the bit of code that does the magic.

$lang = "en_EN";
if (isset($_GET['lang'])) 
	$lang = $_GET['lang'];
putenv("LC_ALL=$lang");
setlocale(LC_ALL, $lang);
bindtextdomain("messages", "locale");
bind_textdomain_codeset('messages', 'UTF-8');
textdomain("messages");
